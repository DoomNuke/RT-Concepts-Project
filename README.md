<------------------------------> RT CONCEPTS PROJECT <------------------------------>

This is my RT-Concepts project made on the Nucleo-F746ZG card,
A dispatcher with three departments, Generation of events and handling each event by priority given,
Prints a status if by any chance one of the tasks can't take the semaphore (in that project I've decided to use counting semaphores to keep track on resources)
A random completion interval aswell.

Have fun! :D
